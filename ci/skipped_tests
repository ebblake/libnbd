# Alpine Linux provides the "expr" utility (under pathname "/usr/bin/expr") in
# one of two forms: (1) as a symlink to the "/bin/busybox" binary executable,
# when the "coreutils" package is not installed, (2) as a symlink to the
# "coreutils" binary executable, otherwise. Both linked-to binary executables
# key their behavior off the name under which they are invoked (that is, argv0).
# Unfortunately, this breaks "lib/test-fork-safe-execvpe.sh": that test case
# copies the "expr" utility to a file called "bin/f", and actually expects
# "bin/f" to work. Both "busybox" and "coreutils" croak when invoked as "f".
